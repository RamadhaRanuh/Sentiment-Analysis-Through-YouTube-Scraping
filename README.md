# Sentiment-Analysis-Through-YouTube-Scraping
This project leverages Google Cloud YouTube API v3 to scrape user comments from YouTube videos, aiming to uncover valuable insights into audience sentiments. The collected data undergoes preprocessing and analysis using three distinct machine learning models:

    Random Forest with Word2Vec features for robust and interpretable predictions.
    Logistic Regression with TF-IDF for efficient and reliable performance on text data.
    LSTM with TF-IDF for capturing sequential patterns in sentiment analysis.

The models demonstrate an impressive average train-test accuracy of 85-90%, showcasing the effectiveness of the approach. This project combines advanced natural language processing techniques with sentiment analysis to deliver meaningful insights into public opinions on YouTube.
